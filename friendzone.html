<b>whaterever friends makes life happier</b>

<p>“I have a friend that I've known since high school, and when you have a real close friendship like that … this is someone who has, in a sense, known you your whole life … When you have those kinds of relationships that go back that far, these are people who knew you before you've become a fully formed person.</p>

<p><b>Poems about Friendship</b><br>
	<b><big>friends for life are just amazing</big></b>

Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, <strong>but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime</strong>. Other friends may not be quite as loving. <small>The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome</small>. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.
